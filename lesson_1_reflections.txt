GIT COMMANDS

git diff <commit1> <commit2>
git log --stat: shows a summary of changed files at every commit
git init: initializes a git repository but doesn't do a commit by itself
git log --graph --oneline <branch1> <branch2>
git show <commit>: shows the difference between a commit and its parent
git remote -v: see all the current remotes, verbose shows urls
